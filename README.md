# Aarush Das Bansiwal â€” Project Repository

This repository serves as a consolidated collection of my academic, research, and personal projects.  

---

## Overview

Each directory in this repository contains an independent project with its own documentation, source code, and dependencies.  
The projects reflect both exploratory research and practical implementations built during academic study, internships, and self-directed learning.

---

Each subfolder under `project/` represents an **independent project**, containing:
- A dedicated `README.md` explaining the concept and usage  
- Source code files (`.py`, `.ipynb`, etc.)

##  How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USER/project.git
