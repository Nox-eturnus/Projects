# Quantum Multi-Target Search using Grover’s Algorithm — Qiskit

**One-line:** A 5-qubit generalized implementation of Grover’s search algorithm that can locate multiple target items in a 32-element dataset, runnable on real IBM Quantum hardware.

---

##  Features

- Implements **Grover’s algorithm** with support for **multiple target states**.  
- Built with **Qiskit 2.X**, using modular **Oracle** and **Diffuser** subcircuits for clarity.  
- Works **IBM Quantum** real backend.  
- Displays **measurement histograms** with binary states.  
- Fully customizable target list and dataset size.
